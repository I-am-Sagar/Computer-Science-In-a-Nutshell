/*
Factor Tree is an intuitive method to understand the factors of a number.
It shows how all the factors are been derived from the number. It is a special
diagram where you find the factors of a number, then the factors of those
numbers, etc until you canâ€™t factor anymore. The ends are all the prime factors
of the original number.

Input : v = 48
Output : Root of below tree
   48
   /\
  2  24
     /\
    2  12
       /\
      2  6
         /\
        2  3

The factor tree is created recursively as follows:

1. We start with a number and find the minimum divisor possible.
2. Then, we divide the parent number by the minimum divisor.
3. We store both the divisor and quotient as two children of the parent number.
4. Both the children are sent into function recursively.
5. If a divisor less than half the number is not found, two children are stored
   as NULL.
