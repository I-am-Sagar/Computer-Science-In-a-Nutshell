/*
What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a
subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single
graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST)
or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph
is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other
spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to
each edge of the spanning tree.

How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has?
An MST has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.

Below are the steps for finding Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's Algo:

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree
   formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step 2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
