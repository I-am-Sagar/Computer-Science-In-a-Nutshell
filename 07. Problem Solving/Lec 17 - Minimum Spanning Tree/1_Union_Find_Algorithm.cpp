Let's say, you have a set of N elements which are partitioned into further subsets,
and you have to keep track of connectivity of each element in a particular subset
or connectivity of subsets with each other. To do this operation efficiently,
you can use Union-Find Data Structure.

Let's say there are 5 people A, B, C, D E. A is a friend of B, B is a friend of C
and D is a friend of E. As we can see:

    1) A, B and C are connected to each other.
    2) D and E are connected to each other.

So we can use Union Find Data Structure to check whether one friend is connected
to another in a direct or indirect way or not. We can also determine the two
different disconnected subsets. Here 2 different subsets are {A, B, C} and {D, E}.

You have to perform two operations here :

    a) Union (A, B) - Connect two elements A and B.
    b) Find (A, B) - Check if Arr[A] is equal to Arr[B] or not.

Initially there are 10 subsets (0-9) and each subset has single element in it.
When each subset contains only single element, the array Arr is:

Arr:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

Whenever we come to know, objects A and B are connected, we do Arr[A] = Arr[B].

i) Union(2, 1)

Arr:    0  1  1  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

ii) Union(4, 3), Union(8, 4), Union(9, 3).

Arr:    0  1  1  3  3  5  6  7  3  3
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

iii) 5) Union(6, 5)

Arr:    0  1  1  3  3  5  5  7  3  3
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

After performing some operations of Union(A ,B), you can see that now there are
5 subsets. First has elements {3, 4, 8, 9}, second has {1, 2}, third has {5, 6},
fourth has {0} and fifth has {7}. All these subsets are said to be 'Connected
Components'.

One can also relate these elements with nodes of a graph. The elements in one
subset can be considered as the nodes of the graph which are connected to each
other directly or indirectly, therefore each subset can be considered as
connected component.

Let's perform some Find(A, B) operations.

i) Find (0, 7) - As 0 and 7 are disconnected, this will gives false result.

ii) Find (8, 9) - Though 8 and 9 are not connected directly, but there exist a
    path connecting 8 and 9, so it will give us true result.

Note: If we perform operation Union(5, 2) on above components, then it will be :

Arr:    0  1  1  3  3  1  1  7  3  3
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

IMPLEMENTATION 1: (Naive Union and Find implementation)

Initially there are N subsets containing single element in each subset, so to
initialize array we will use initialize() function.

void initialize(int Arr[], int N) {
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    Arr[i] = i ;
}

// Following function returns true if A and B are connected
bool find( int Arr[ ], int A, int B) {
    if(Arr[A] == Arr[B])
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

// Change all entries from Arr[A] to Arr[B].
void union(int Arr[], int N, int A, int B) {
    int temp = Arr[A];
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if(Arr[i] == temp)
            Arr[i] = Arr[B];
    }
}

As loop in Union function iterates through all the N elements for connecting
two elements. So performing this operation on N objects will take O(N^2) time,
which is quite inefficient. Here is another approach:

We can consider a root element of each subset, which is a only special element
in that subset having itself as the parent. Let's say R is a root element, then
    Arr[R] = R.

To make it more clear, let's take a subset S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Initially each element is the root of itself in all subsets, as Arr[i] = i,
where i is element in the set, therefore root(i) = i.

Arr:    0  1  2  3  4  5
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5

Performing Union(1, 0) will connect 1 to 0 and will set root(0) as the parent
of root(1). As root(1) = 1, and root(0) = 0, therefore value of Arr[1] will be
changed from 1 to 0. It will make 0 as a root of subset containing elements
{0, 1}.

Arr:    0  0  2  3  4  5
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5

Now performing Union(0, 2), will indirectly connect 0 to 2, by setting root(2)
as the parent of root(0). As root(0) is 0 and root(2) is 2, therefore it will
change value Arr[0] from 0 to 2. Now 2 will be the root of subset containing
elements {2, 0, 1}.

Arr:    2  0  2  3  4  5
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5

Similarly Union(3, 4) will indirectly connect 3 to 4, by setting root(4) as the
parent of root(3). As root(3) is 3 and root(4) is 4, therefore it will change
value of Arr[3] from 3 to 4. It will make 4 as a root of subset containing
elements {3, 4}.

Arr:    2  0  2  4  4  5
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5

Performing Union(1, 4) will indirectly connect 1 to 4, by setting root(4) as the
parent of root(1). As root(4) is 4 and root(1) is 2, therefore it will change
value of Arr[2] from 2 to 4. It makes 4 as root of set containing elements
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Arr:    2  0  4  4  4  5
Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5

After performing required Union(A, B) operations, we can easily perform the
Find(A, B) operation to check whether A and B are connected or not. It can be
checked by calculating roots of both A and B. If roots of A and B are same, that
means both A and B are in same subset and are connected.

How to calculate root of a element?

As we know that Arr[i] is the parent of i (where i is the element of set), then
the root of i is Arr[Arr[Arr[... Arr[i] ...]]] until Arr[i] is not equal to i.
Simply we can run a loop until we get a element which is a parent of itself.
Note: This can be only done when there is no cycle in the elements of subset,
otherwise loop will run infinitely.

Find(1, 4) - 1 and 4 have same root as 4, therefore it means they are connected
and this operation will give true as a result.

Find(3, 5) - 3 and 5 do not have same root, as root(3) is 4 and root(5) is 5.
It means they are not connected and it will give false as a result.

IMPLEMENTATION 2: (Union-Find by finding parent)

// finding root of an element.
int root(int Arr[], int i) {
    //chase parent of current element until it reaches root.
    while (Arr[i] != i) {
        i = Arr[i];
    }
    return i;
}

// modified union function where we connect the elements by changing the root
void union(int Arr[], int A, int B) {
    int root_A = root(Arr, A);
    int root_B = root(Arr, B);
    Arr[root_A] = root_B;       //setting parent of root(A) as root(B).
}

bool find(int A, int B) {
    // if A and B have same root, means they are connected.
    if(root(A) == root(B))
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

Now as you can see, in worst case, this idea will also take linear time in
connecting 2 elements and even in finding that if two elements are connected or
not, it will take linear time.

Another disadvantage is that while connecting two elements, we do not check
which subset has more element than other and sometimes it creates a big problem
as in worst case we have to perform approximately linear time operations.

We can avoid this, by keeping the track of size of each subset and then while
connecting two elements, we can connect the root of subset having smaller number
of elements to the root of subset having larger number of elements.

Consider the folllowing subsets:

    3                   6               <= Roots
   / \                 / \
  1   2               7   5
                    / \    \
                   9   4    10

Here if we want to connect 1 and 5, then we will connect the root of Subset A
(subset which contains 1) will be connected to root of Subset B (contains 5),
this is because Subset A contains less number of elements than of Subset B.

It will balance the tree formed by the above operations. We call this operation
as weighted_union operation.

IMPLEMENTATION 3: (Union-Find by Rank)

Initially the size of each subset will be one as each subset will have only one
element and we can initialize it in the initialize function discussed above:

size[ ] array will keep track of size of each subset.

// modified initialize function
void initialize(int Arr[], int N) {
    for(int i = 0; i<N; i++) {
        Arr[i] = i;
        size[i] = 1;
    }
}

// root() and find() function will be same as above.

// modified union function
void weighted-union(int Arr[], int size[], int A, int B) {
    int root_A = root(A);
    int root_B = root(B);

    if(size[root_A] < size[root_B]) {
        Arr[root_A] = Arr[root_B];
        size[root_B] += size[root_A];
    }
    else {
        Arr[root_B] = Arr[root_A];
        size[root_A] += size[root_B];
    }
}

Take an example:

You have a set S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Initially all the subsets have a single
element and each element is a root of itself.

Size   1  1  1  1  1  1
Arr    0  1  2  3  4  5
Index  0  1  2  3  4  5

Perform Union(0, 1). Here we can connect any root of any element with root of
other one as both the elementâ€™s subsets have same size and then we will update
the respective size. If we connect 1 to 0 and make 0 as a root and then size of
0 will change from 1 to 2.

Size   2  1  1  1  1  1
Arr    0  0  2  3  4  5
Index  0  1  2  3  4  5

While performing Union(1, 2), we will connect root(2) with root(1) as subset of
2 has less number of elements than number of elements in subset of 1.

Size   3  1  1  1  1  1
Arr    0  0  0  3  4  5
Index  0  1  2  3  4  5

Similarly in Union(3, 2), it will connect root(3) to root(2) as subset of 3 has
less number of element than number of elements in subset of 2.

Size   4  1  1  1  1  1
Arr    0  0  0  0  4  5
Index  0  1  2  3  4  5

Maintaining a balance tree will reduce complexity of union and find function
from N to log2(N).

Can we improve more?

While computing the root of A, set each i to point to its grandparent
(thereby halving the path length), where i is the node which comes in between
path, while computing root of A.

IMPLEMENTATION 4: (Union Find Algo with Path Compression)

// modified root function.
int root (int Arr[], int i) {
    while(Arr[i] != i) {
        Arr[i] = Arr[Arr[i]];
        i = Arr[i];
    }
    return i;
}

When we use Weighted-union with path compression it takes log2* N for each union
find operation, where N is the number of elements in the set.

log2* N => log2(log2(N))

Now that we know how to implement - Union Find Algorithm, it's time to use it.
Let's try to detect cycles using Union-Find Algo in the graph.
